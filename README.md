## About me
My name is lucid. I am a 14 year old full stack developer from VA, USA. I primarily mess around with code, make cheats, and also software. I also love music, and wrestling. My two favorite artists are Juice WRLD and Playboi Carti. If I seem somewhat interesting, join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/4sdB3UYcFg), I make, sell, and give out software and cheats there, and it is also a nice server to hang out in.
